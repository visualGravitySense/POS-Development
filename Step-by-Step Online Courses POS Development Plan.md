# Step-by-Step Online Courses POS Development Plan

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Planning (Week 1-2)

### Step 1: [[Define Project Requirements]]

- Create user stories for both course creators and students
- List essential features for your MVP
- Define technical requirements and constraints
- Establish success metrics for your test project

### Step 2: Choose Your Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js (popular, extensive resources)
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express (JavaScript across the stack)
- **Database**: MongoDB (flexible schema for early development)
- **Payment Processing**: Stripe API (developer-friendly)
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth or Auth0 (secure, ready-made)
- **Hosting**: Vercel, Netlify, or Heroku (free tiers available)

### Step 3: Set Up Development Environment

- Install necessary software (Node.js, code editor, Git)
- Create GitHub repository for version control
- Set up project structure and initial configuration
- Initialize frontend and backend projects
- Configure basic CI/CD pipeline

## Phase 2: Core Feature Development (Week 3-6)

### Step 4: Database Schema & Backend Structure

- Design database schema for courses, users, transactions
- Set up MongoDB connection and models
- Create API endpoints structure
- Implement basic error handling and logging

### Step 5: Authentication System

- Implement user registration and login
- Create role-based permissions (admin, instructor, student)
- Set up secure session management
- Create protected routes

### Step 6: Course Management Features

- Build course creation interface for instructors
- Implement course listing and detail views
- Create content management system for course materials
- Add course search and filtering functionality

### Step 7: Shopping and Checkout

- Create shopping cart functionality
- Implement Stripe payment integration
- Design checkout flow
- Add order confirmation and receipts

## Phase 3: Dashboard & Testing (Week 7-8)

### Step 8: Reporting & Analytics

- Build instructor dashboard showing sales and student activity
- Create student dashboard showing enrolled courses
- Implement basic analytics tracking
- Design simple reports for key metrics

### Step 9: Testing & Bug Fixes

- Perform unit testing on critical components
- Conduct integration testing across the platform
- Do manual testing of the complete user journey
- Fix identified bugs and issues

## Phase 4: Deployment & Validation (Week 9-10)

### Step 10: Deployment

- Configure production environment
- Deploy database (MongoDB Atlas)
- Deploy backend application
- Deploy frontend application
- Set up domain and SSL certificate

### Step 11: User Testing

- Conduct testing with 3-5 potential instructors
- Test with 5-10 potential students
- Gather feedback using structured questionnaires
- Document common issues and feature requests

### Step 12: Iteration

- Prioritize feedback and create an iteration plan
- Implement high-priority fixes and improvements
- Document lessons learned
- Plan next phase of development

## Development Milestones

- **End of Week 2**: Project setup complete, repository initialized
- **End of Week 4**: Authentication and basic course management working
- **End of Week 6**: Payment processing and checkout functioning
- **End of Week 8**: Complete working prototype on local environment
- **End of Week 10**: Deployed MVP with initial user feedback
