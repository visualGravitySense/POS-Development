## First Steps to Take Today

1. **[[Start with user stories]]** - Write down who will use your system and what they need to accomplish. For example:
    - "As a course creator, I want to upload video content so students can access it after purchase"
    - "As a student, I want to browse available courses and filter by topic"
2. **Set up your GitHub repository** - Create a new repo with a clear [[README.md]] that outlines your project goals. This gives you structure from day one.
3. **Choose your starting point** - Begin with either:
    - The course catalog (content management side)
    - The student shopping experienceI recommend starting with the course catalog since it's the foundation everything else builds upon.
4. **Create wireframes** - Use a free tool like Figma or even paper sketches to visualize your key screens.

## Early Development Focus

For the actual coding, start with these elements:

1. **Basic project structure** - Set up your React frontend and Node/Express backend
2. **Database connection** - Implement MongoDB models for courses and users
3. **Simple UI components** - Create reusable components for course cards, navigation, etc.
4. **Authentication** - Implement login/signup functionality early

This plan is designed to give you a working prototype within 10 weeks. The most critical phases are weeks 3-6 when you'll build the core functionality.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific part of this development plan? Or would you prefer guidance on setting up the initial project structure?
